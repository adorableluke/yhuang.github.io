I am now a Ph.D student at Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, advised by [Professor Hongwei Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=rXMoLdwAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). I received M.S from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2020, co-advised by [Professor Zuyuan He](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Kx0GvtUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and [Professor Wenjia Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=3UVo_IYAAAAJ). Before coming to SJTU, I graduated from Sichuan University with B.S degree in 2017. I joined Advanced Optical Technology Laboratory, Huawei Technologies in 2020-2021 as a Senior Research Engineer.

My work bridges high performance computation and optics. Conventioanl electronic computer is facing challenges in computing bandwidth and power consumption when processing deep learning applications, due to the adopted Von Neumann architecture. My current research interest focuses on accelerating AI tensor computation with silicon photonics and optical siganl processing technologies, including on-chip optical diffractive tensor core with metasurfaces,  optical neural network with time-wavelength interleaving and implicit representation on photonic devices and systems.
